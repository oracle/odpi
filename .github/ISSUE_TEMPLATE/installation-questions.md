Thank you for using ODPI-C.

Do these before creating a new issue:

    If you are installing a driver like cx_Oracle, node-oracledb, godror, or any other driver that uses ODPI-C then open an issue on the driver's issue page.

    Review the user manual: https://oracle.github.io/odpi/doc/index.html

    If you have a `DPI-1047`, `DPI-1050` or `DPI-1072` error, re-review the link above.

    Google any errors.

Then please answer these questions so we can help you.

GitHub issues that are not updated for a month may be automatically closed.  Feel free to update them at any time.
